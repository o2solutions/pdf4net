The `TaggedTextExtractor` sample shows how to extract text from a PDF file in the reading order defined by the document's tag structure.
The first step is to retrive the structure elements representing content items in reading order. Then the text runs are extracted from the document.
Next the text runs are placed in reading order based on their associated structure element. Finally the text runs are combined into lines of text.
