The `TaggedFlowDocument` sample shows how to create a fully tagged PDF document using the FlowDocument API.

Just by setting the EnableAutomaticTagging property to true on the PDFFlowDocumentDefaults object that is passed to the PDFFlowDocument constructor, the document is tagged automatically.

The sample also shows how to customize the tagging information for the logo image.
